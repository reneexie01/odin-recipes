    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous Korean dishes, bibimbap means "mixed rice," where bibim = mixed and bap = rice. It is a cooked rice dish traditionally featuring lightly sauteed vegetables, kimchi, bellflower root, fern brake (gosari) yellow pickled radish (danmuji), marinated meat (such as bulgogi beef), egg, and bibimbap sauce, which contains gochujang Korean red pepper sauce. The arrangement of the vegetables is aesthetically pleasing, with the egg serving as the centerpiece. All the ingredients are stirred together before enjoying.</p>

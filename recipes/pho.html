    <h1>Pho</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pho is a popular Vietnamese soup that’s made with a savory broth, rice noodles, herbs, aromatics, and meat—usually beef or chicken—and it’s served with a plate of fresh herbs, bean sprouts, sliced chilies, and lime wedges on the side. The traditional recipe is a time-consuming process that involves simmering roasted beef bones, meat, and spices in broth for several hours to extract all the flavors and nutrients. But there is a simpler and quicker way to make delicious pho at at home. By using a combination of store-bought beef and chicken broth simmered with onions, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise, you can make a fragrant broth that’s reminiscent of traditional pho. Best of all, this “quick pho” can be prepared in just 45 minutes, making it a convenient option for busy weeknights.</p>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice one of the onion quarters as thin as possible; set aside. </li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring the remaining 3 onion quarters, beef broth, chicken broth, water, fish sauce, ginger, </li>cinnamon stick, sugar, star anise, and cloves to a boil. 
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Off the heat, add the noodles. Let sit, stirring regularly </li>to prevent sticking, until the noodles are soft and pliable but still not tender, 5 to 10 minutes. 
        <li>Drain and rinse well with cold water. </li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>
        <li>Over a large bowl, strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer. </li>
        <li>Discard the solids and pour the clear broth back into the pot. (Alternatively, you can use a fine mesh </li>spider to fish out the solids.)
        <li>Bring the broth to a boil and add the noodles; cook until the noodles are just tender, 30 seconds to 1 </li>minute. Using tongs or a spider, lift the noodles from the pot and divide evenly into bowls. 
        <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the sliced beef to the broth; let simmer until no longer pink, about 1 </li>minute. 
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or spider, remove the beef from the broth and divide between the bowls. </li>
        <li>Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary. </li>
        <li>Ladle the broth over the noodles and beef. </li>
        <li>Top each bowl with the reserved thinly sliced onions, bean sprouts, and cilantro (you may not need all of </li>the onions). 
        <li>Pass the lime wedges, hoisin, and sriracha at the table.</li>
    </ol>
